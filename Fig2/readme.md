# Analysis of airborne LiDAR derived carbon map

This folder contains all data, shapefiles and code for analysing the airborne LiDAR derived carbon map in Asner _et al_ (2018), and plotting associated Figure. For use or developements of [Figure2Code.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipsonChristopher/CarbonRecovery/master/Fig2/Figure2Code.R) for the figure or analysis please cite [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/266838510.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/266838510)

Any use of the data (figure or analysis) presented here should cite both Philipson  _et al_ (2020) and the orginal data source Asner _et al_ (2018) [Mapped aboveground carbon stocks to advance forest conservation and recovery in Malaysian Borneo](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.020) in Biological Conservation

Please also state : "The forest carbon map was derived from Global Airborne Observatory data of the Arizona State University's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science."
